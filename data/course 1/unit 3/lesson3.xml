<entryTitle>What is skew? How do you skew block-level elements with CSS3?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>CSS3 transformations also allow you to skew block-level
elements, slanting them at an angle either horizontally
(skewX) or vertically (skewY).
<br>We use the animation and transform properties to skew a
rectangle and text horizontally by 45 degrees. </paragraph>

<entryTitle>With CSS3, how can you use fonts for your web page if they are not already installed on the user’s system?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>Using the @font-face rule, you can specify fonts for a
web page, even if they’re not installed on the user's
system.
<br>You can use downloadable fonts to help ensure a
uniform look across client sites.

<entryTitle>What are :nth-child selectors? What can they be used for?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>In CSS3, you can use selectors to easily select
elements to style based on their attributes.
<br>We use :nth-child selectors to select each of the
four div elements in the flexbox div to style.
<br>div:nth-child(1) selects the div element that’s
the first child of its parent and applies the
background-color LightBlue.
<br>Similarly, div:nth-child(2) selects the div
element that’s the second child of its parent,
div:nth-child(3) selects the third child of its
parent, and div:nth-child(4) selects the fourth
child of its parent—each applies a specified
background-color.</paragraph>

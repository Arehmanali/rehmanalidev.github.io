<paragraph>
The CSS3 text-shadow property makes it easy to
add a text shadow effect to any text (Fig. 5.1).
<br>The text-shadow property has four values which
represent:
</paragraph>
<unorderedList>
<item>Horizontal offset of the shadow—the number of pixels that
the text-shadow will appear to the left or the right of the
text. A negative value moves the text-shadow to the left; a
positive value moves it to the right.
</item>
<item>Vertical offset of the shadow—the number of pixels that the
text-shadow will be shifted up or down from the text. A
negative value moves the shadow up, whereas a positive
value moves it down.
</item>
<item>blur radius—the blur (in pixels) of the shadow. A blurradius
of 0px would result in a shadow with a sharp edge
(no blur). The greater the value, the greater the blurring of
the edges.</item>
<item>color—determines the color of the text-shadow.
</item>

<entryTitle>What web servers are available and where you can download a web server from the Web?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>
The Apache HTTP Server, maintained by the Apache Software
Foundation, is currently the most popular web server. It's open source
software that runs on UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and numerous
other platforms.
MySQL is the most popular open-source database management system.
It, too, runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
The Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database server and PHP can each be
downloaded and installed separately, but this also requires additional
configuration on your part.
For simplicity, we'll use the XAMPP integrated installer provided by the
Apache Friends website (www.apachefriends.org).
Go to <link source='http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html'>XAMPP</link>
Choose the installer for your platform. Carefully follow the provided
installation instructions and be sure to read the entire installation page
for your platform!
If you'd prefer to use PHP with Microsoft's IIS Express and SQL Server
Express, you can use their Web Platform Installer to set up and configure
PHP: <link source='http://www.microsoft.com/web/platform/phponwindows.aspx'>PHP on Windows</link>

<entryTitle>What does a web server do?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>A web server responds to client requests (typically
from a web browser) by providing resources such
as HTML documents. When users enter a Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) address, such as
www.deitel.com, into a web browser, they're
requesting a specific document from a web server.
The web server maps the URL to a resource on the
server (or to a file on the server's network) and
returns the requested resource to the client. 
A web server and a client communicate using the
platform-independent Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP), a protocol for transferring requests and
files over the Internet or an intranet.

<entryTitle>What are start tags and end tags?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>
HTML5 documents delimit most elements with a start tag
and end tag.
A start tag consists of the element name in angle brackets
For example, &lt;html&gt; <br>
An end tag consists of the element name preceded by a
forward slash (/) in angle brackets
<br>For example, &lt;/html&gt;
<br>There are several so-called "void elements" that do not
have end tags.
<br>Many start tags have attributes that provide additional
information about an element, which browsers use to
determine how to process the element.

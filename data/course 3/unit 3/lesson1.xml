<entryTitle>What is raw Ajax?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>"Raw" Ajax uses JavaScript to send asynchronous requests to
the server, then updates the page using the DOM
<br>When writing "raw" Ajax you need to deal directly with crossbrowser
portability issues, making it impractical for
developing large-scale applications

<entryTitle>What are asynchronous requests?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>Client creates an XMLHttpRequest object to manage a request
<br>XMLHttpRequest object sends the request to and awaits the response
from the server
<br>Requests are asynchronous, allowing the user to continue interacting with
the application while the server processes the request concurrently
<br>When the server responds, the XMLHttpRequest object that issued the
request invokes a callback function, which typically uses partial page
updates to display the returned data in the existing web page without
reloading the entire page

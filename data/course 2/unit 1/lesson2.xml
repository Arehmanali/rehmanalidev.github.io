<entryTitle>In JavaScript, how do you get input from a user?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>
The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the visitor for input. A prompt box is often used if you want the user 
to input a value before entering a page. Note: When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to 
proceed after entering an input value.

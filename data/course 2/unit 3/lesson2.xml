<entryTitle>What are the onload, onclick, and onerror events?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>The window object's load event fires when
the window finishes loading successfully
(i.e., all its children are loaded and all
external files referenced by the page are
loaded)
<br>Every DOM element has a load event, but
it's most commonly used on the window
object.
<br>The onclick event is triggered when the mouse is clicked.
<br>The onerror event is triggered whenever there is an error loading an external file.

<entryTitle>What is event bubbling in dynamic HTML?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>The process whereby events fired on child elements
"bubble" up to their parent elements
<br>When an event is fired on an element, it is first
delivered to the element's event handler (if any),
then to the parent element's event handler (if any).
To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, there's a method event.stopImmediatePropagation() .

<entryTitle>What are dynamic styles? How do you change the style of an element dynamically?</entryTitle>
<paragraph>Through the DOM, you have access to a style object that describes the style of an element. 
This style object is defined as a CSSStyleDeclaration; you can see a detailed explanation of this 
at the W3C documentation of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface. The style object doesn't quite work 
the same as some of the other properties defined in your HTML element. Unlike element.href or element.id,
 which return strings, element.style returns an object. This means you cannot set the style by
  assigning a string to element.style.
<br>The style object has attributes that correspond to the different CSS properties we set. For example, style.color 
returns the colour that element has set on it. By calling element.style.color = "red"; you can 
apply the style change dynamically.
<br><br>Example:
<br>
function colorElementRed(id) {
  var el = document.getElementById(id);
  el.style.color = "red";
}
